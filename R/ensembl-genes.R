#' Generate a table of gene symbols mapped to Ensembl IDs
#'
#' Simplify the table of Ensembl gene ID mappings provided by MSigDB.
#' MSigDB provides a CHIP file with canonical Ensembl IDs for each gene, but there are some genes with many (over ten) IDs.
#' This function additionally reduces the number of multi-mapping IDs based on those actually appearing in MSigDB.
#'
#' @param x A list of data frames returned by `msigdb_sqlite()`.
#'
#' @returns A data frame with gene symbols and Ensembl IDs.
